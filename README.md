# Getting all file size of a dir ðŸ“‚

Launching this script can help you getting a list of all elements of the target repository and get info such as size, path and name.

A xlsx file is generated once the work is done.

## Custom

You _must_ specify a path once launched, if there are no folders to skip the script will get every single of the whole repo (including subfolders).

To specify the folders to avoid you can declare them like the following (after answering **yes** to the input question):

```
folder anotherfolder subfolder
```
